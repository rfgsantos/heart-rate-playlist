# heart-rate-playlist
Create Spotify playlists based on the Heart Rate reaction to music.

## Introduction
This is my graduation project for ISEL - LEIM. The idea of the project started as a way to integrate wearables and smartwatches for fisiological monitoring in a social network or networking software, such as Slack or Discord.
After the first meetings the idea faded away and started to become solidify with these objectives in mind. There had to be a time where vital signs would be read and a time these signs would be used to integrate with a popular social application. We chose Spotify because it has support for development and the content it provides is appreciated by the whole world.
